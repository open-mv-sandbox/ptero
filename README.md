## Pterodactil

Pterodactil is a toolkit for working with [dacti formats](https://github.com/open-mv-sandbox/dacti).

> ðŸš§ Everything in this workspace is not ready for production use. All formats, implementations, and other details are subject to change at any time. If you want to try out elements in this workspace regardless for testing and validation purposes, coordinate with the maintainers.

## Dacti Viewer

To explore the development of dacti, this repository contains a reference viewer implementation. This viewer may be eventually split out and renamed to become its own application in the future.

## Building Standalone JS Library

This project uses wasm-bindgen to create the JS bindings around the WebAssembly based package. To generate the package for use in projects, run `wasm-pack build` in the JS crate's directory. See the [wasm-pack documentation](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-pack/) for more information.

You do not need to build the library manually for the web example.
